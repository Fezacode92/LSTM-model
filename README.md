## LSTM Toxicity Predictive Model for YouTube Comment Analysis

This repository contains a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) predictive model designed to analyze toxicity in YouTube comments. The model utilizes deep learning techniques to classify the toxicity level of comments, providing valuable insights for content creators and platform administrators.

### Dataset

The model has been trained on a diverse and labeled dataset of YouTube comments, consisting of both toxic and non-toxic examples. The dataset has been carefully curated to ensure a balanced representation of different comment types.

### Model Architecture

The LSTM architecture is employed to capture the sequential nature of textual data and learn complex patterns within comments. The model is trained using a combination of word embeddings and recurrent neural networks, enabling it to effectively understand and predict the toxicity level of comments.

### Usage

To utilize the predictive model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies mentioned in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Preprocess your YouTube comment data by cleaning, tokenizing, and encoding the text.
4. Load the trained LSTM model provided in the repository.
5. Input your preprocessed comments into the model for toxicity prediction.

### Results and Evaluation

The model has undergone rigorous training and evaluation to ensure its accuracy and generalizability. Detailed performance metrics, such as precision, recall, and F1-score, are provided to assess the model's effectiveness in classifying toxicity levels accurately.

### Contributions and Future Improvements

Contributions to this repository are welcome. If you have any ideas for enhancing the model's performance, improving the dataset, or adding new features, please feel free to submit a pull request.

Potential areas for future improvements include:
- Expanding the dataset with more diverse comment types.
- Experimenting with different neural network architectures for enhanced accuracy.
- Integrating additional contextual features to improve predictions.
